JPedal (LGPL) - Open Source PDF Viewer
======================================

Forked from [Lonzak/JPedal](https://github.com/Lonzak/JPedal). 

Threw away a bunch of stuff that doesn't matter. Rearranged the code to be more consistent with the maven way of doing things.

The javadoc wouldn't build without Java 8. The code depends on classes that only exist in 8 and the javadoc tool will not work without those classes existing. 

Pushed the code to maven central.
